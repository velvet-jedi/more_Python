1) It removes sections of each line of a file,
    so operating on each line separately
    possibly input from some other utility like
    ls -l | cut −d ' ' −f 5−7
    the way the script accepts input can be explicitly 
    stated files or piped outputs from other commands like 
    ls -l or echo
    
    so standard input standard output from sys module and of course the argparse module

2) Options from the man page to be implemented:
    a) -f select these fields
    b) -d delimiter
